                <p>Why do some people, some teams, some companies create outstanding work, while others seem stuck in mediocrity? Why do some of us excel in creativity, have better ideas, and find ways to make ideas happen while others don’t?</p>
                <p>That question has been on my mind for quite some time now. The more I thought about this, the more I came to believe that it is less about the capabilities of the individual or the team, but more about the ability to focus.</p>
                <p>Focus and attention have become a rare currency in today’s distracted society. Yet at the core, attention defines our successes, our failures, our happiness, and perhaps more importantly: who we are.</p>
                <p>How do you spend your time?</p>
                <p>If you get up and you start your day answering emails or working on things that are important to others but not to yourself, chances are you’ve already started your day in mediocrity. You’ve just limited your capacity to create something great.</p>
                <p>It’s easy to commit to too many projects, write a bunch of emails, and help others whenever they ask for your advice. It keeps you busy, feels like you’re needed, and you get a sense of getting stuff done. But how much of that working time is spent *creating* things you actually care about?</p>
